# Movie Killer
*Note: While this is a working prototype for any movies transferred to your iOS device from external sources, it turns out that the intended recipients get a majority of their movies from the iTunes Store. Access to those media resources is explicitly restricted for third-party apps and limits Movie Killer's potential usefulness. I've learned what I wanted and stopped working on this app, but you should feel free to adapt it for your purposes!*

An iOS video player that crashes intentionally.

## But why?
Sam and Nerissa's kids complain if their parents interrupt movies that they're watching. However, if the movie app just crashes for some reason, they assume there's nothing to be done and move on. Sam proposed I make an app that will just crash after a bit so that the kids can be dissuaded from watching too long without generating a fuss.

Also, I wanted to learn more about ReSwift and media playback in iOS.
